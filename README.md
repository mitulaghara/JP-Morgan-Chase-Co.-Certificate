# JP-Morgan-Chase-Co.-Certificate

I just completed JPMorganChase's Software Engineering on Forage. In the simulation I:
Integrated Kafka into a Spring Boot microservice to consume and deserialize high-volume transaction messages using a configurable topic and embedded Kafka test framework.
Implemented transaction validation and persistence logic with Spring Data JPA and an H2 SQL database, including entity modeling and balance updates across relational User records.
Connected the service to an external REST Incentive API using RestTemplate, processing incentive responses and incorporating them into transactional workflows.
Developed a REST endpoint for querying user balances, returning JSON responses through a Spring controller while maintaining clean architectural boundaries.
Verified system behavior using Maven test suites and debugger-driven inspection, ensuring reliability across message ingestion, database operations, and external API interactions.
